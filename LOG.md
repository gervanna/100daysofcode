# 100 Days of Code - Log
## Day 1 
*11/22/20*

I started the course and so far it's pretty straightforward. Did the interactive coding activities on Repl.it: printing, debugging, input and variables. I'm going to be using Visual Studio Code for projects and will push to GitHub daily.

Project: Band Name Generator

## Day 2
*11/23/20*

Found that round doesn't return two decimal places if the second decimal is a zero, so had to use string formatting though I don't fully understand that idea just yet. f strings aren't as daunting as I had previously assumed.

Project: Tip Calculator

## Day 3
*11/24/20*

I had some issues with the nested if loops during the videos, but the project gave me lots of practice. I solved the Leap Year exercise using comparison operators, because I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to make the if statements pass. The love calculator exercise had me stumped for a bit, because I wanted to run count on everything at once instead of making a variable for each. I really loved the project for day 3, the ASCII art was really cool and I used stackoverflow to find out how to add some colour to my game. 

Project: Treasure Island

## Day 4
*11/25/20*

Honestly, I did a bad job of transferring the concepts this time around. I had most of the ideas in my head, but couldn't for the life of me extrapolate them properly. Will rewatch these videos. Also, this line of code doesn't capture errors anymore because of the list indexing used to grab and print the game pictures - 
if player >= 3 or player < 0:
    print("\nThat wasn't a valid choice. You lose.")

*UPDATE* - figured out the issue with some help after brainstorming, it was the placing of if statement and needed to change the "or" to "and". Who knew RPS was this challenging? lol

Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Day 5
*11/26/20 - 11/27/20*

Finding a way to come up with my own len and sum was challenging, but after I did that exercise the max coding activity was pretty neat. The password generator project was awesome! This took longer than the one day, cuz you know, life. But I'm happy with my outcomes.

Project: Password Generator
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 6
*11/27/20*

The robot maze project has proved to me that I have no sense of direction. There are definitely some things I will review but this was fun even when the robot just moved in circles. I will revisit this project to fix the issue of if the robot gets stuck in an infinite loop.

Project: Escaping the Maze
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 7
*11/28/20*

Ask me how many times I got frustrated today while doing this and I couldn't give you a solid number. Abstracting code ideas is very confusing for me sometimes. I'll have the idea of how it should be done but the positional arguments fail me sometimes. I also learned about the *requests* module today in order to make a request to a webpage and print the response. I used this module to get a word list to be used with the Hangman game.

Project: Hangman
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 8
*11/29/20*

Project: Caesar Cipher
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 9
*11/30/20*

Project: Secret Auction
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 10
*12/01/20*

Fixed the indefinite loop issue with my Day 8 project, I was missing parentheses. I was doing a Python course with ITexperience and I need to do a project for that. Decided today that I will modify one of these projects I have done and use Tkinter to develop it further.

Project: GUI w/Tkinter
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Days 11 - 22
*12/02/20 - 12/13/20*

I spent the past twelve days learning about and working with Tkinter in order to create a GUI for my Rock Paper Scissors game. Check out the **[repo](https://github.com/gervanna/RockPaperScissors-with-Tkinter).**

## Day 23
*12/14/20*

Completed the calculator project based on Angela's specifications then researched how to do validation based on inputs to catch if user inputted strings or keys in not in dictionary so that the program wouldn't throw an error and just break. Used try/except to catch these errors and print messages for the user. Also put each section in while loops so the except could continue and loop back after an error.

## Fell off The Wagon (FoTW) - restart #1
*01/02/21*

I've lost track of which day I'm on honestly, because I've gotten so frustrated with the code and not being to solve problems and use hints given succesfully. I'm taking a step back but not stopping like I have for the past few weeks. I listened to ["Overwhelmed with programming"](https://youtu.be/5CmjW_8ief4) by Scott Hanselman. Read about [Namespaces](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-python-namespaces-and-why-are-they-needed--cms-28598) and started reading the book, ["Your first Year in Code" by Isaac Lyman et al.](https://leanpub.com/firstyearincode)
