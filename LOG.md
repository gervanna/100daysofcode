# 100 Days of Code - Log
## Day 1 
*11/22/20*

I started the course and so far it's pretty straightforward. Did the interactive coding activities on Repl.it: printing, debugging, input and variables. I'm going to be using Visual Studio Code for projects and will push to GitHub daily.

Project: Band Name Generator
>**status - Complete**

## Day 2
*11/23/20*

Found that round doesn't return two decimal places if the second decimal is a zero, so had to use string formatting though I don't fully understand that idea just yet. f strings aren't as daunting as I had previously assumed.

Project: Tip Calculator
>**status - Complete**

## Day 3
*11/24/20*

I had some issues with the nested if loops during the videos, but the project gave me lots of practice. I solved the Leap Year exercise using comparison operators, because I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to make the if statements pass. The love calculator exercise had me stumped for a bit, because I wanted to run count on everything at once instead of making a variable for each. I really loved the project for day 3, the ASCII art was really cool and I used stackoverflow to find out how to add some colour to my game. 

Project: Treasure Island
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 4
*11/25/20*

Honestly, I did a bad job of transferring the concepts this time around. I had most of the ideas in my head, but couldn't for the life of me extrapolate them properly. Will rewatch these videos. Also, this line of code doesn't capture errors anymore because of the list indexing used to grab and print the game pictures - 
if player >= 3 or player < 0:
    print("\nThat wasn't a valid choice. You lose.")

*UPDATE* - figured out the issue with some help after brainstorming, it was the placing of if statement and needed to change the "or" to "and". Who knew RPS was this challenging? lol

Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 5
*11/26/20 - 11/27/20*

Finding a way to come up with my own len and sum was challenging, but after I did that exercise the max coding activity was pretty neat. The password generator project was awesome! This took longer than the one day, cuz you know, life. But I'm happy with my outcomes.

Project: Password Generator
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 6
*11/27/20*

The robot maze project has proved to me that I have no sense of direction. There are definitely some things I will review but this was fun even when the robot just moved in circles. I will revisit this project to fix the issue of if the robot gets stuck in an infinite loop.

Project: Escaping the Maze
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 7
*11/28/20*

Ask me how many times I got frustrated today while doing this and I couldn't give you a solid number. Abstracting code ideas is very confusing for me sometimes. I'll have the idea of how it should be done but the positional arguments fail me sometimes. I also learned about the *requests* module today in order to make a request to a webpage and print the response. I used this module to get a word list to be used with the Hangman game.

Project: Hangman
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 8
*11/29/20*

Project: Caesar Cipher
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 9
*11/30/20*

Project: Secret Auction
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Day 10
*12/01/20*

Fixed the indefinite loop issue with my Day 8 project, I was missing parentheses. I was doing a Python course with ITexperience and I need to do a project for that. Decided today that I will modify one of these projects I have done and use Tkinter to develop it further.

Project: GUI w/Tkinter
>**status - COMPLETE**

## Days 11 - 22
*12/02/20 - 12/13/20*

I spent the past twelve days learning about and working with Tkinter in order to create a GUI for my Rock Paper Scissors game. Check out the **[repo](https://github.com/gervanna/RockPaperScissors-with-Tkinter).**

## Day 23
*12/14/20*

Completed the calculator project based on Angela's specifications then researched how to do validation based on inputs to catch if user inputted strings or keys in not in dictionary so that the program wouldn't throw an error and just break. Used try/except to catch these errors and print messages for the user. Also put each section in while loops so the except could continue and loop back after an error.

## Fell off The Wagon (FoTW) - restart #1
*01/02/21*

I've lost track of which day I'm on honestly, because I've gotten so frustrated with the code and not being able to solve problems and use hints given successfully. I'm taking a step back but not stopping like I have for the past few weeks. I listened to ["Overwhelmed with programming"](https://youtu.be/5CmjW_8ief4) by Scott Hanselman. Read about [Namespaces](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-python-namespaces-and-why-are-they-needed--cms-28598) and started reading the book, ["Your first Year in Code" by Isaac Lyman et al.](https://leanpub.com/firstyearincode)

## FoTW - restart #2
*01/03/21*

The #explainlikeimfive on dev.to is pretty neat. I pair-coded and practiced some flowchart making and translated a lottery game flowchart into python code. Read chapters 5 & 6 of ["Your first Year in Code" by Isaac Lyman et al.](https://leanpub.com/firstyearincode) and started a Cybersecurity Fundamentals course with IBM skills build.

## FoTW - #3
*01/04/21*

Finished module 1 of IBM skills course. Used flow chart to write the code for a 'Password Chooser' to check for specific length of characters, capitals, numbers and symbols etc. Read chapters 7 & 8 of Your 1st Year in Code. 

## FoTW - #4
*01/05/21*

Started module 2 of IBM skills course. Was looking at the [Web Dev. Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) on Github, though I doubt Web Dev. is the route I want to pursue, it was pretty interesting. Officially decided to take a pause on Angela Yu's Udemy course. For the mean time, I'm going to spend some time on translating flowcharts and building small things to practice my understanding what a project requires and the whole idea of flow control and logic. Read chapters 9 & 17 of Your 1st Year in Code, skipped a few in between being that the book isn't chronological in the topics it explores.  

## FoTW - #5
*01/06/21*

Working through module 2 of IBM skills course. Started working on another flow chart today. The goal for the next 4 - 6 weeks is reading more content and I want to dive into [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com).

## FoTW - #6
*01/07/21*

Finished module 2 of IBM skills course. You'd think that since I made a Hangman game on day 7, ages ago, I'd be able to do one now on my own. 

## FoTW - #7
*01/08/21*

Finished module 3 of IBM skills course. Read an article - ["Identity-Based Habits: How to Actually Stick to Your Goals This Year"](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits) by James Clear. Found out about an awesome repository [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects).

## FoTW - #8
*01/09/21*

Finished the Cybersecurity Fundamentals and started one called "Working in a Digital World: Professional Skills". 

## FoTW - #9
*01/10/21*

Going through the digital world course. Not a lot of coding done to be honest.

## FoTW - #10
*01/11/21*

Pair coding to finish that Hangman game. Figured out I could've used a function for parts of the code, so implemented that. Then thought of modules re grabbing words from requests and the code is small so it didn't need that adjustment, but messed around with creating a module and using it inside the code for practice. Used docstrings to clarify what functions did what.

## FoTW - #11
*01/12/21*

Turned the Adv. Lottery flowchart into python code. It was good. Found that the "shorter" way to do a thing is probably not the easiest or most clear way. 

## FoTW - #12
*01/13/21*

Finished module 1 of the digital world course. No coding today.

## FoTW - #13
*01/14/21*

Started [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com).

## FoTW - #14
*01/15/21*

Finished sections 2 & 3 of [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com).

## FoTW - #15
*01/16/21*

Finished sections 4 & 5 of [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com). Made a program with python, to run the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). Finished module 2, Collaborate Effectively, of the digital world course. 

## FoTW - #16
*01/17/21*

Finished section 6 of [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com).
Completed the Comma Code program. Unfinished Coin Flip Streaks program.

## FoTW - #17
*01/18/21*

Still unable to finish the Coin Flip Streaks program.
