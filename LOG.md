# 100 Days of Code - Log
## Day 1 
*11/22/20*

I started the course and so far it's pretty straightforward. Did the interactive coding activities on Repl.it: printing, debugging, input and variables. I'm going to be using Visual Studio Code for projects and will push to GitHub daily.

Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator

## Day 2
*11/23/20*

Found that round doesn't return two decimal places if the second decimal is a zero, so had to use string formatting though I don't fully understand that idea just yet. f strings aren't as daunting as I had previously assumed.

## Day 3
*11/24/20*

I had some issues with the nested if loops during the videos, but the project gave me lots of practice. I solved the Leap Year exercise using comparison operators, because I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to make the if statements pass. The love calculator exercise had me stumped for a bit, because I wanted to run count on everything at once instead of making a variable for each. I really loved the project for day 3, the ASCII art was really cool and I used stackoverflow to find out how to add some colour to my game.

## Day 4
*11/25/20*

Honestly, I did a bad job of transferring the concepts this time around. I had most of the ideas in my head, but couldn't for the life of me extrapolate them properly. Will rewatch these videos. Also, this line of code doesn't capture errors anymore because of the list indexing used to grab and print the game pictures - 
if player >= 3 or player < 0:
    print("\nThat wasn't a valid choice. You lose.")

*UPDATE* - figured out the issue with some help after brainstorming, it was the placing of if statement and needed to change the "or" to "and". Who knew RPS was this challenging? lol

Day 4 Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Day 5
*11/26/20 - 11/27/20*

Finding a way to come up with my own len and sum was challenging, but after I did that exercise the max coding activity was pretty neat. The password generator project was awesome! This took longer than the one day, cuz you know, life. But I'm happy with my outcomes.
