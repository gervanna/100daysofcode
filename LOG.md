# 100 Days of Code - Log
## Day 1 
*11/22/20*

I started the course and so far it's pretty straightforward. Did the interactive coding activities on Repl.it: printing, debugging, input and variables. I'm going to be using Visual Studio Code for projects and will push to GitHub daily.

## Day 2
*11/23/20*

Found that round doesn't return two decimal places if the second decimal is a zero, so had to use string formatting though I don't fully understand that idea just yet. f strings aren't as daunting as I had previously assumed.

## Day 3
*11/24/20*

I had some issues with the nested if loops during the videos, but the project gave me lots of practice. I solved the Leap Year exercise using comparison operators, because I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to make the if statements pass. The love calculator exercise had me stumped for a bit, because I wanted to run count on everything at once instead of making a variable for each. I really loved the project for day 3, the ASCII art was really cool and I used stackoverflow to find out how to add some colour to my game.

## Day 4
*11/25/20*

Honestly, I did a bad job of transferring the concepts this time around. I had most of the ideas in my head, but couldn't for the life of me extrapolate them properly. Will rewatch these videos. Also, this line of code doesn't capture errors anymore because of the list indexing used to grab and print the game pictures - 
if player >= 3 or player < 0:
    print("\nThat wasn't a valid choice. You lose.")

*UPDATE* - figured out the issue with some help after brainstorming, it was the placing of if statement and needed to change the "or" to "and". Who knew RPS was this challenging? lol

## Day 5
*11/26/20 - 11/27/20*

Finding a way to come up with my own len and sum was challenging, but after I did that exercise the max coding activity was pretty neat. The password generator project was awesome! This took longer than the one day, cuz you know, life. But I'm happy with my outcomes.

## Day 6
*11/27/20*

The robot maze project has proved to me that I have no sense of direction. There are definitely some things I will review but this was fun even when the robot just moved in circles. I will revisit this project to fix the issue of if the robot gets stuck in an infinite loop.

Day 6 Project: Escaping the Maze

## Day 7
*11/28/20*

Ask me how many times I got frustrated today while doing this and I couldn't give you a solid number. Abstracting code ideas is very confusing for me sometimes. I'll have the idea of how it should be done but the positional arguments fail me sometimes. I also learned about the *requests* module today in order to make a request to a webpage and print the response. I used this module to get a word list to be used with the Hangman game.
