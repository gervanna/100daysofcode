# Welcome to my attempt at the 100 Days of Code

**Thanks for stopping by!**

I'm doing the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2020 with Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu. 

I'm not sure if I will be publicly committing on Twitter just yet, but I will be trying my best to complete all projects, log my progress and finish my 100 days by March 2, 2021.
